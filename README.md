# Formative 1 - Databases
In this project we will are using a netfix dataset from Kaggle, Link (). That data will be stored in both a MySQL database and in MongoDB as well. We have have created an API that retrieves data from the MySQL database that is hosted on Railway and used the data to train our model.

## MySQL Database & MongoDB - Nina
The realationship Database in the this project is a MySQL database that contains 3 normalized tables: Movies, Ranking & Performance. The relational database has been hosted on Railway and the nosql option is MongoDB. the relational database contains a stored procedure for the Movies table that adds movies to it and a trigger that automatically logs updates to an audit table when any INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE happens on the Movies table. It can be manual updates to the movies table or by calling the stored procedure.
